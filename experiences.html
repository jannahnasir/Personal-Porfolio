<center><h2 style="background-color: #1AD6B9"> &#127801 ACCOUNTING FIELD </h2>
<center><h3 style= "background-color:#C0C0C0 ;"> In this accounting field, first task given to me during my practical training is in this field. I was assigned a company named SAS Auto Services. I am doing this company alone compare to other student practical do with their pair and they can also do their work faster than me. This task was done and completed by me and other practical trainee, which from Universiti Malaysia Sabah and Politeknik Kota Bharu that is Ms Mashitah and Ms Alya. The task is quite easy for me as the firm use UBS Accounting software as their tool for accounting and we are familiar with the software. Our supervisor first assigns the task to make sure we understand all the accounting work and know all terms in accounting with the guidance from her. For this company is a type of sole proprietorship business known as business wholly owned by a single individual using personal name as his trade name or identity card. This task was started by study the nature of the business as I am not familiar with the company we are dealing with. In order to understand that, I have to dig in all the documents sent by the client, sort the documents according to their type as the company did not prepare the documents accordingly, and go through months from January until December such as for their expenses, sales and others document that were include. It is important for me to understand the nature of the business, when it comes to posted all the transaction made by the company into the UBS Accounting there will be no mistake in classifying the items.In this field of work, I started by back up all the data for the previous year transaction and then do the year end processing. Before key in the transaction into UBS, I have to ensure the reference number for the invoices, payment voucher and others. Only then I can key in the transaction that occur for the year. I start keyed in the data by posting the transaction for the sales, purchases and other expenses that occur during the year. During the process of posting the transaction, any purchases or expenses related to amount that material or assets I have to photocopy the document of purchase, invoices or payment voucher. This is for the audit purpose and evidence for the material expenses in amount for the company. Then, I keyed in the transaction for the debtors and creditors of the company. After finish posting the transaction for sales, purchases, payment made and payment received, I need to check whether the transactions are tally with the statement of creditors provided by the company to us. After all the transactions are recorded, especially bank transaction, bank recognition will been make by comparing the transaction in cheque book and bank receive with the bank statement. This is to ensure all the transaction is related and when the cheques are clear. This process is called bank reconciliation. The last step I done is to back up all the work that have been done and send it to supervisor for review. If any errors occur, an adjustment needs to be done to the data. If no errors, the completed transactions are then printed out to be sent for an auditing proces.</h3>

<center><h2 style="background-color: #1AD6B9"> &#127801 SECRETARIAL WORKS </h2>
<center><h3 style= "background-color:#C0C0C0; ;">In this field, I did not do much works and I also did not spend too much time to do this work compare to others staff. I do annual return form. For this annual return form, I assigned this works asked by my firm manager Mr Mat Salleh bin Mat Jusoh. I have to continue the work done by him by referring to the annual return of other company. And I would change the names of directors and each shares in the company. I also have to edit the work done by him. I am editing process, I have that there is no spelling error and grammatical error done by him. Other thing I have to do is an item that similar or almost similar to other, for this part I have to combine the items involved to be the one perfect item. I must to ensure that the information in the annual return is correct and accurately. For example name of directors, company’s name, and share in the company. This task is quite easy for me because form of annual return already have and just need to edit by different type of company. After that, Mr Salleh also recheck my work done by me before proceed to print out and for other progress.
Others information that I have for my knowledge, an annual report need submit to SSM every year that provide by secretary. Usually annual return contains information of changes of director or share in the company. I am so lucky to have done this annual return as my task during industry training. No wonder that my manager asked me to do this work as my knowledge about accounting and so on.
In other word, I am so lucky at all because only me that assigned this work compare to other practical students. I am also grateful to everyone that teach me about this especially to Ms Mashitah that explain more about annual return clearly to me. </h3>

<center><h2 style="background-color: #1AD6B9"> &#127801 ADMINISTRATION FIELD </h2>
<center><h3 style= "background-color:#C0C0C0 ;">For this field, I also not do too much because I focus to accounting system (UBS) to key in so many document of the company. 
The task that I do in this field is to deal with the client if managing partner or the company manager is not around. When the client came to the office and asked for the manager, I will entertain them because my working place in front of the door that people can see. That why I am the first person who can answer their regards. What I do is tell them that the manager that they asked for is not around and asked for the reason they are there. If the demand are easily be fulfill I will granted it, if not I have to ask them to come again later.
Another task that I am doing is once in a week I did cleaning work. This work will do by rotation by different person. For an example I swept area of the office and throw away any garbage or so on.
Besides that, another thing that did is if I the early person come to the office, I will turn on all computers that employees need to use later. So other staff can easily use the computer and proceed to do their work. Do not forget my boss’s computer. I also arrange all the files that need to arrange properly on the table or cabinet. This work actually is for volunteer their self to do this work anytime or for their free time.</h3>

<center><h2 style="background-color: #1AD6B9"> &#127801 CONCLUSION </h2>
<center><h3 style= "background-color:#C0C0C0 ;"> For 16 weeks of industrial training, I have learned all types of accounting process from recording the payment voucher, debit credit accounts, ledger accounts, trial balance, balance sheet, profit and losses accounts and I get chances to apply knowledge. During this four months practicum I learn to practice all knowledge I learn in the class. When study in the theory we do not understand fully but when come to real working we get a picture how to apply our knowledge. Practicum helps to expose us to real working situation. Other than what we learn in theory also gain extra knowledge about the purpose of auditing each item. What I already learned is more clearly from semester 1 until semester 5. Now I know what is lecturer wants us to know about accounting and difficult of working with other people.
During my industrial training, the problems that I faced is when the document of client incomplete. This thing can make me stuck to do accounting system (UBS). Example of document that is incomplete such as bank statement, payment voucher, expenses, statement of debtors and creditors and other document involved.
Another problem that I faced when I need to communicate with clients if there is no other staff in office. Such as I need to find their document that they needed. For the first I need to call my senior accountant, Ms Mashitah to get permission if any document of client that given to them. Besides that, this kind of work I get opportunities to deal with client properly.</h3>
